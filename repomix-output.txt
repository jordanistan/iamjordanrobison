File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# EthicalCheck addresses the critical need to continuously security test APIs in development and in production.

# EthicalCheck provides the industry’s only free & automated API security testing service that uncovers security vulnerabilities using OWASP API list.
# Developers relies on EthicalCheck to evaluate every update and release, ensuring that no APIs go to production with exploitable vulnerabilities.

# You develop the application and API, we bring complete and continuous security testing to you, accelerating development.

# Know your API and Applications are secure with EthicalCheck – our free & automated API security testing service.

# How EthicalCheck works?
# EthicalCheck functions in the following simple steps.
# 1. Security Testing.
# Provide your OpenAPI specification or start with a public Postman collection URL.
# EthicalCheck instantly instrospects your API and creates a map of API endpoints for security testing.
# It then automatically creates hundreds of security tests that are non-intrusive to comprehensively and completely test for authentication, authorizations, and OWASP bugs your API. The tests addresses the OWASP API Security categories including OAuth 2.0, JWT, Rate Limit etc.

# 2. Reporting.
# EthicalCheck generates security test report that includes all the tested endpoints, coverage graph, exceptions, and vulnerabilities.
# Vulnerabilities are fully triaged, it contains CVSS score, severity, endpoint information, and OWASP tagging.

## :dart: About ##

Here is an example of a Dockerfile that can be used to build a container for a scalable website:


## :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Docker](https://Docker.io) installed.

## :checkered_flag: Starting ##

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanistan/iamjordanrobison

# Access
$ cd iamjordanrobison

```

Dockerfile that can be used to build a container for a scaleable website:

```bash
FROM python:3.8

# Install the necessary libraries
RUN pip install flask

# Copy the web server code
COPY server.py .

# Run the web server
CMD ["gunicorn", "server:app", "-b", "0.0.0.0:80", "-w", "4"]
```

This Dockerfile installs the necessary libraries and runs a simple Flask web server using Gunicorn. Gunicorn is a WSGI HTTP server that is designed to be efficient and easy to use, and it is well-suited for running high-concurrency web applications.

The -b flag specifies the bind address and port that Gunicorn should listen on, and the -w flag specifies the number of worker processes to use. By default, Gunicorn uses a single worker process, but you can increase this number to handle more traffic.

To build the container, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t hire-jordan
``` .
This will build a Docker image with the tag "hire-jordan" based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

To run the container locally, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 hire-jordan
```

This will start a container based on the "hire-jordan" image and bind the container's port 80 to the host machine's port 8080. You should then be able to access the website by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

Note: Make sure that port 8080 on the host machine is not already in use by another process. If it is, you can choose a different host port by changing the first number in the -p flag (e.g. -p 8000:80).

## :dart: About ##

This script clones the repository to a local directory and creates a Dockerfile with instructions to build a container with the necessary dependencies and run the web application. It then builds the Docker image and runs the container, exposing port 5000 on the host machine. Finally, it opens the website in a browser and waits for the user to press enter to stop the container.

Note: This script assumes that the repository contains a file named requirements.txt with a list of the necessary Python packages, and a file named app.py with the code for the web application. It also assumes that the Docker Python library is installed.

## :checkered_flag: Starting ##


```bash
# To use the Python script to clone a Git repository and run the code locally in a browser:
# Make sure that you have the Docker Python library and GitPython library installed. You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install docker
pip install GitPython


# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanistan/iamjordanrobison/building-a-simple-server/python

# Run
cd repo

# Run the project
python hire-me.py


# The server will initialize in the <http://localhost:3000>
```
The script will clone the repository, create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a container based on the image. It will then open the website in a browser and wait for the user to press enter to stop the container.

This script is useful for quickly running and testing a web application locally without having to install the necessary dependencies manually. It can also be useful for deploying the application to a remote server or hosting platform.

Note: The script assumes that the repository contains a file named requirements.txt with a list of the necessary Python packages, and a file named app.py with the code for the web application. It also assumes that the Docker daemon is running on the host machine.

## :dart: About ##

Here is an example of Terraform configuration that will run a static website in a Docker container using a variable file with temporary inputs and an output file:

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanistan/$repo

# Access
$ cd $repo

# To build and run the container, you can use the following commands:

terraform init
terraform apply

# After running these commands, the static website will be accessible at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. The output file will show the names of the resources that were created (i.e. the Docker image and container).

#To stop the container and remove it, you can use the following command:

terraform destroy

#This will stop and remove the container, as well as any other resources that were created as part of the configuration.





```

## :dart: About ##

Welcome to  iamjordanrobison.com

This site was created to allow opportunities to come to me.

* To stand out from other job candidates by showcasing your personal brand and unique qualifications.

* To showcase your portfolio of work and highlight your achievements and skills.

* To make it easy for potential clients or partners to learn more about you and your business.

Overall, a resume website is a great way to promote yourself and your career online and can be an effective tool for job search and career advancement.

From the website you will see a variety of skills I have obtained over the years. You will also be able to download my resume from the website. In fact, maybe the reason you are reading this is because you were sent to the website.

The other great part about the website is this allows people to schedule the time to speak with me. Without the back and forth of finding what time works best. This allows YOU...YEAHH YOU!!!! To see my availability without having to wait for a reply back. You book the day and time and it shows up on yours and my calendar. Be sure to accept the invite in your email. On the day of the interview you will be notification about the meeting. Join the Zoom Meeting.
